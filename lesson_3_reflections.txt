When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

This is a convenient way to share files among collaborators. It is also a way to facilitate off-site backup of my repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I want to main control of the synching process, so I don't inadvertently publish something to GitHub that isn't ready to be shared.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A Fork creates a new GitHub repository from an existing GitHub repository and shows the Commit history of the original repository in the new one. A clone copies a repository from one place (local or remote) to another. A branch creates a separate sandbox for experimentation that can later, if desired, be merged back into master (or some other branch).

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

If you don't like a change that someone made, you can undo it.
